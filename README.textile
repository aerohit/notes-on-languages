h1. Collection of notes for various languages I learn.

Some ideas to organize the notes:

* Create an index page that would provide link to all the notes.
* Could use a naming scheme like "hello.clj.html".
* Each file could have some meta-data like what file name to use etc.


Some guidelines:

* Write every line of code in the book.
* Include some kind of explanations with the code.
* Belive in fast progress.
